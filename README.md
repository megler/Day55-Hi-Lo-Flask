Pick a number between 0-9 with Flask. Day 55 Python Bootcamp


## Usage
Using Flask to generate a website, pick a number between 0-9. Your guess will 
generate a new web page and tell you if you're high, low or correct. You pick a
number by entering it as part of the URL:

`http://127.0.0.1:5000/5`

or

`http://127.0.0.1:5000/9`

The page will update based on your guess and tell you if you're correct or need
to guess again.

This project utilizes Flask variables to pass the guess and update the page.
